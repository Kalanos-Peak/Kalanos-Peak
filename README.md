# 👋 Hi, I’m @Kalanos!  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where the code is fresh, and the bugs are... "features"!  

## About Me  
- 👀 I’m interested in **robotics**, **cyber-physical systems**, and occasionally breaking things to see how they work (sorry, Raspberry Pi).  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my Arduino and Raspberry Pi best friends without making one jealous of the other.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **robotics projects**, **IoT experiments**, and anything that involves making LEDs blink for no reason other than "it looks cool."  
- 📫 How to reach me: Carrier pigeons are overrated. Just DM me here or send me an email at kntywdkailash@gmail.com.  
- 😄 यद्भावं तद्भवति
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once spent 3 hours debugging my code only to realize the Arduino wasn’t even plugged in.  

## My Motto  
*"If it’s not working, add more duct tape... or maybe double-check the wiring first."*  

### What You’ll Find Here  
- 💡 Beginner-friendly robotics projects because we're all just trying our best.  
- 🛠️ Weird experiments where code meets hardware, and sparks may literally fly.  
- 🐛 Occasional bugs, but hey, they keep life interesting!  

Thanks for stopping by! Drop me a star ⭐️ or just say hi! 😊
